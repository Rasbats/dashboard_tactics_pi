The _wxWebView_ component is needed here and its back-end browser technology is very old. For example, on Windows it is at the level of _Internet Explorer 11 (IE11)_! One cannot run modern web-developments on it but _DashT_ takes a modern line graph library [tui.chart](https://github.com/nhn/tui.chart), [polyfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)) it, and writes for you software which allowing to use [InfluxDB](../influxdb/influxdb.ipynb#Introduction) aggregation methods on the data read back from that very same time series database.
