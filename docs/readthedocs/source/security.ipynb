    "1. **Signal K server node delta channel** - **LOW**\n",
    "  - _Risk Assessment_: This is a TCP/IP socket with text based protocol (Signal K / JSON). Since it is based on a subscription, its usage is low volume and data is parsed character by character in various level of parsers, first in JSON parser and then in Signal K parser. Both parsers are incorporated in _DashT_ code base and constantly passed through an external security vulnerability parser ;\n",
    "  - _Implementation_: Several vulnerabilities, such as non-zero ending strings and similar have been fixed after the reports of those from the external advisory ;\n",
    "  - _Evolution_ : In case of the inactivity of the development, no commits will be made to trigger the inspection and the external advisories will not be able to inspect the existing code against the new, detected vulnerabilities.\n",
    "2. **OpenCPN Plug-In ABI** - **HIGH**\n",
    "  - _Risk Assessment_: The API implementation (ABI) is out of configuration control of _DashT_. It has been developed, in organic manner during the entire lifespan of _OpenCPN_ to meet the functional requirements. There is no security policy or security implementation plan available when this is made. However, the code base is entirely available and inspectable: the external advisory reports several issues in the _OpenCPN_ code base, thus applicable to the plug-in as well. Without security-enabled _OpenCPN_ we need to consider the ABI it provides as a possible vector of attack ;\n",
    "  - _Implementation_: The _DashT_ code base addressing and using the _OpenCPN_ ABI is regularly scanned against the very same vulnerabilities and they are all fixed and the scan is constantly maintained in every commit. When applicable, a copy of the data retrieved from _OpenCPN_ is made and passed through the _DashT_ code on which the security fixes have been made ;\n",
    "  - _Evolution_ : It is likely but not guaranteed that _OpenCPN_ community publish a security policy and starts implementing fixes to the code which creates a security vulnerability report. Meanwhile, the same inactivity risk of the _DashT_ code itself will remain - more there is development, more there will be security fixes. There is no guarantee that this is a constant activity in this regard.\n",
    "3. **InfluxDB v2** - **LOW**\n",
    "  - _Risk Assessment_: InfluxData is a company which has huge number of clients, both paying and free around the world. They have a clear, world-wide [security reporting policy](https://www.influxdata.com/how-to-report-security-vulnerabilities/) ;\n",
    "  - _Implementation_:  _DashT_ does not incorporate any of the third party software but asks the end user to download and installs it. This makes sure that user gets also the latest security updates ;\n",
    "  - _Evolution_ The risk can be in the evolution of the client side, interfacing software. This is copied as a snapshot from repositories of InfluxData. It may occur that a security issue is detected in those and we would not be necessarily aware of the fix. However, since this code is integrated, it passes also the consant integration security checks and it is likely that the vulnerability be eventually detected. For this, the development must be continuous. \n",
    "4. **C++ / JavaScript instrument API** - **VERY LOW**\n",
    "  - _Risk Assessment_: This is a proprietary, text base API. In both sides text parsing takes into account the applicable security advisory for both programming platforms ;\n",
    "  - _Implementation_: The parsing code and command implementing code is passed through the external security advisory during continuous integration - the TypeScript / JavaScript code is passed on two, independent platform. In addition, the _node_modules_ development environment is also checked against vulnerable development modules at each commit. It must be noted that none of this code is addressing external, unknown servers ;\n",
    "  - _Evolution_ : The threats in web technologies are moving ahead quickly. A pause in the development usually causes an avalanche of reports next time the development will start again. This can go over the capacity of the developer to deal with all proposed fixes and they may be ignored. "
