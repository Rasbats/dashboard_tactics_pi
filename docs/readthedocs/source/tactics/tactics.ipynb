NKE does this correction in its regatta processor only, but not on their normal instruments.\n",

Manufacturers normally already do correct this, if you have a heel sensor integrated in your instrument bus. O will simply receive the already corrected data for AWS / AWA then. The result would be wrong data ! I implemented this option for those sailors using an external (or DIY) heel sensor, which is not recognized by their instrument system.

The idea is simply to have a fallback for the true wind calculation in case your log fails and also to eliminate side effects on the calculation by surface current.
