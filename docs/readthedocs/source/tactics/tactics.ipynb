NKE does this correction in its regatta processor only, but not on their normal instruments.\n",
    "1. **Correct AWS/AWA with Heel** : This option corrects your AWS and AWA data by the heel angle. Use this option with great care !. Manufacturers normally already do correct this, if you have a heel sensor integrated in your instrument bus. O will simply receive the already corrected data for AWS / AWA then. The result would be wrong data ! I implemented this option for those sailors using an external (or DIY) heel sensor, which is not recognized by their instrument system. You'll get a warning popup as soon as you set the tick.\n",
    "1. **Use SOG instead of STW for True Wind Calc** : Replaces STW (Speed through water, the “log”) with SOG (from the GPS) in the internal true wind calculation.  The idea is simply to have a fallback for the true wind calculation in case your log fails and also to eliminate side effects on the calculation by surface current.
