NKE does this correction in its regatta processor only, but not on their normal instruments.\n",
    "1. **Correct AWS/AWA with Heel** : This option corrects your AWS and AWA data by the heel angle. Use this option with great care !. Manufacturers normally already do correct this, if you have a heel sensor integrated in your instrument bus. O will simply receive the already corrected data for AWS / AWA then. The result would be wrong data ! I implemented this option for those sailors using an external (or DIY) heel sensor, which is not recognized by their instrument system. You'll get a warning popup as soon as you set the tick.\n",

The idea is simply to have a fallback for the true wind calculation in case your log fails and also to eliminate side effects on the calculation by surface current.

As soon as the gennaker start working aerodynamically, it’ll speed up the boat and your AWA will show lower values (points more foreward). If you gybe now, your boat speed will drop, and although sailing the same TWA, your app. wind angle will be higher than before. You will have to bring you boat back up to speed to see the same AWA than before the tack. This can be tricky when you’re close to a buoy and don’t have much space/time to speed up your boat again."

    "| CMG | Course Made Good; the relative speed approaching a waypoint. This term may be customized to whatever you like. See the [ini/conf-file chapter](../tweaks/tweaks.ipynb#DashT/Tactics) for _“CMGSynonym”_ |\n",

    "| HDG | Magnetic heading of your compass; not compensated with mag. variation |\n",
    "| HDT | True heading of your compass. “True” means compensated with magnetic variation |\n",
    "| Heel | The angular degrees how your boat is heeled (leaning) sideways due to any force from outside (wave, wind, water ballast on one side of the boat, swing keel etc....) |\n",
    "| CRS | Course through water; HDT + Leeway, but without currents |\n",
    "| Leeway | The drift of your boat caused by the wind. As soon as the wind is blowing it implies a force on your boat, the boat starts drifting. Leeway is **not** including any drift due to surface currents ! That's actually the challenge :-) you can manage with Tactics! |\n",
