Of course, it is not a consumer of engine data and it is not even remotely interested in knowing if the ice cube machine is still working but it needs the time, position and other navigational data for its routing and map functions. Also, it needs to feed the majority of its plug-ins - including DashT - with NMEA-0183 data through its internal multiplexer gateway towards these third party consumers. Even though the Signal K Delta channel interface would not be used in **_O_**penCPN, a Signal K server node is able to provide the data in NMEA-0183 format to the chartplotter."
