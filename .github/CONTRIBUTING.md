Hi, thank you for considering a contribution to the _DasthT_ plug-in project!

In order to save your and developer's valuable time, it would not be a waste of it to read first the current state of the project from
**this branch's** [developer's manifesto](../docs/developers/README.md) - you may want to read also the manifesto from the branch you are
contributing to.

Shortly:

* Checkout and commit your PR in a branch which starts with 'pr' - for pull request
* Trusting that you have tested correctly before suggesting your fix
  * This is a multiplatform project: please check at least that all Continuous Integration (CI) tests have passed, at minimum
  
Thank you!
