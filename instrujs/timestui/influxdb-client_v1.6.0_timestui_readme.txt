As for now: In package.json, a fixed version: 1.0.0 ! Why?

Because I have been only able to polyfill that version for IE11!
It is needed in Windows version of OpenCPN / wxWidgets / wxWebView.

I manage to browserify v1.6.0 for Chrome based browsers alright.

But for IE11 the same method (you can see here) fails - I suspect
(but I am not sure that it is the 'extends' some base class like Error which
is not liked by IE11. See this promising poly-fill
https://github.com/WebReflection/custom-elements#readme
but I gave up since there is no idea how to get it working with TypeScript...
)
Anyway, version v1.0.0 for perfectly both on Linux and Windows so
as long it is working, we keep it like that and no effort is put on this
for now - maybe time will fix the issue somewhere else).

For the record, here is how I _did_ browserify successfully v1.6.0:

------------
"@influxdata/influxdb-client": "1.6.0",

- But this is only the node-version, so pro-forma only: we need to download
  the package and browserify / polyfill for IE11 (!) ourselves!

  ATTENTION: GET vs OPTIONS - where v1.0 was using GET method to retrieve
                              data and status information, (since InfluxDB
                              alpha versions allowed it), this version
                              is using OPTIONS (allowed together with POST).
                              This has an impact to theCORS proxy settings
                              in nginx.conf.

Modified, for browserify:

--------------------------
influxdb-client\packages\core\src\InfluxDB.ts

Line 6:
// replaced by ./impl/browser/FetchTransport in browser builds
// import TransportImpl from './impl/node/NodeHttpTransport'
import FetchTransport from './impl/browser/FetchTransport'

Line 35:
// this.transport = this._options.transport || new TransportImpl(this._options)
this.transport = this._options.transport || new FetchTransport(this._options)

--------------------------
influxdb-client\packages\core\src\impl\browser\FetchTransport.ts

(inserted - one needs isomorphic-fetch for IE11 in runtime)
// IE11 AbortController:
import 'isomorphic-fetch'
import 'abortcontroller-polyfill/dist/polyfill-patch-fetch'

--------------------------
influxdb-client\packages\core\src\observable\index.ts
Defined in tsconfig.json
  "baseUrl": ".",
  ...
  "paths": {
      "observable": ["./influxdb-client/packages/core/src/observable/index.ts"]
      "query": ["./influxdb-client/packages/core/src/query/index.ts"]
   }
 Then _everywhere_ where it they are referred with relative path,
 like "./observable", or "../observable", one needs to change to "observable",
 or to "query", respectively
influxdb-client\packages\core\src\QueryApi.ts
influxdb-client\packages\core\src\impl\QueryApiImpl.ts
  but in
influxdb-client\packages\core\src\impl\ObservableQuery.ts
  it must be
} from '../observable/index'
  (don't ask why)

  --------------------------
